# Lab 1: Setup AI Project and perform Chat Completion from VS Code

### Estimated Duration: 120 Minutes

## 📘 Scenario

Contoso Health Services plans to establish a centralized AI development environment for building intelligent AI-powered applications. Before developing AI agents, the organization must configure an AI Project in Microsoft Foundry, deploy the required AI models, and validate connectivity from Visual Studio Code.

In this lab, you will act as an AI Engineer responsible for setting up the AI environment and validating the integration by performing a chat completion call from Visual Studio Code.

## 📖 Overview

In this lab, you will configure the required environment for building AI agents. You will start by creating and configuring an AI Project in Microsoft Foundry, then deploy a Large Language Model (LLM) along with embedding models.

You will next establish connectivity between Visual Studio Code and the AI Project. To validate the setup, you will perform a basic chat completion request using the deployed model.

## 🎯 Objectives

In this lab, you will perform:

- Task 1: Create a Microsoft Foundry Resource
- Task 2: Deploying an LLM and embedding models
- Task 3: Assign permissions to the Azure resources
- Task 4: Install dependencies, create a virtual environment, and create an environment variables file.
