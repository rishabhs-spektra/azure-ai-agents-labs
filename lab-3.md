# Lab 3: Build a RAG Agent

### Estimated Duration: 60 Minutes

## 📘 Scenario

Contoso Health Services maintains a large collection of health policy documents, benefits guides, and compliance manuals. Employees often struggle to quickly locate accurate information across these documents.

In this lab, you will act as an AI Engineer and build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) AI Agent using Azure AI Search as the vector database. The agent will retrieve relevant document content and generate contextual responses grounded in enterprise health plan documentation.

## 📖 Overview

In this lab, you will build an AI Agent powered by **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to extract insights from health plan documents. Using **Azure AI Search** as a vector database, you will store and retrieve document embeddings to enable context-aware and accurate responses. This hands-on experience will help you understand how to implement RAG-based solutions and integrate Azure AI Search for improved document-driven interactions.

## 🎯 Objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Create the Azure AI Search Index
- Task 2: Create the Search Agent

## Task 1: Create the Azure AI Search Index

## Task 2: Create the Search Agent

In this task, you will build an AI Agent using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to extract and generate responses from health plan documents stored in **Azure AI Search**. By leveraging the **Azure AI Agent Service**, the agent will retrieve document embeddings for accurate and context-aware answers.

1. Navigate back to **Visual Studio Code** on your **Lab VM**.
   
1. Open the **Lab 3 - Create A RAG Agent.ipynb** file, This **Lab 3 - Create A RAG Agent.ipynb** notebook guides you through building an AI agent using the **Azure AI Agent Service**. This agent will retrieve information from health insurance policy documents stored in **Azure AI Search**, a vector database, enabling efficient and accurate information retrieval.

   ![](./media/new/g12.png)

1. In the notebook interface, click **Select kernel (1)** in the top-right corner and choose **venv (Python 3.X.X) (2)** from the available options.

   ![](./media/new/h1.png)
   
1. Run the first cell to set up the foundation for a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Agent using Microsoft Foundry. This script imports necessary libraries, loads environment variables, and initializes components like AIProjectClient for project management and AzureAISearchTool for retrieval capabilities.

   ![](./media/new/h2.png)

1. Run the next cell to connect to your Microsoft Foundry project and access the deployed GPT-5.4 model.

   ![](./media/new/h3.png)

1. Run the next two cells to retrieve the connection ID for your Azure AI Search instance and connect to the "health-plan" index. This ensures your RAG Agent can fetch relevant data from Azure AI Search for retrieval-augmented generation.

   ![](./media/new/h4.png)

   ![](./media/new/h5.png)

1. Run the next cell to define a search agent that utilizes Azure AI Search and the GPT-5.4 model to retrieve relevant health plan documents. It will get the values for GPT model dynamically via env variables.

   ![](./media/new/h6.png)

1. Run the next cell to chat with the search agent and retrieve details about the Northwind Standard health plan using Azure AI Search and GPT-5.4. This script initiates a conversation, queries the agent for health plan information, and displays the agent’s response.

   ![](./media/new/h7.png)
   
1. Observe the output returned by the AI agent.
